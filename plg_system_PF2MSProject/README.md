Projectfork 4: Export Projects to MS Project
===========================================

A Joomla system plugin that adds an export dropdown button to each Project in the Projects Overview page.
Currently the only export option is to MS Project. Over time other export formats will be supported.


##Quick Start
Install via Joomla's Extenstion Manager. Once installed configure the plugin's parameters.

The plugin generates a xml file that is compatible with MS Project.
